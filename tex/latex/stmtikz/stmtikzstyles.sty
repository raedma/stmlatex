% From the pgf manual 2.10csv page 694:
% 
%     It should be noted that all calculations must not exceed +-16383.99999 at any point, because the underlying computations rely on TeX dimensions. This means that many of the underlying computations are necessarily approximate and that in addition, are not very fast. TeX is, after all, a typesetting language and not ideally suited to relatively advanced mathematical operations. However, it is possible to change the computations as described in Section 76.
% 
% From the TeX Book page 114:
% 
%     16383.99998pt (TeX's largest dimen)
% 
% In Notes On Programming in TeX Chirstian Feuersaenger pointed out
% 
%     The \dimen registers perform their arithmetic's internally with 32 bit scaled integers, so called scaled point with unit sp. It holds 1pt = 65536sp = 216sp. One of the 32 bits is used as sign. The total number range in pt is [-(2^30-1)/2^16,(2^30-1)/2^16 ]=[-16383.9998, +16383.9998]1.

%     1 Please note that this does not cover the complete range of a 32 bit integer, I do not know why
