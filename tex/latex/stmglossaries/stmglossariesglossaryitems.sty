    The Material Point Method is an alternative to pure Lagrangian approaches and is well suited to problems involving very large deformations. In the method, equilibrium computations take place on a background grid but the calculations are based on information (mass, volume, stress, state variables, etc.) held at material points that are convected through the background grid as the material deforms. This allows computations to take place on an undistorted background mesh (structured or unstructured) whilst modelling problems involving very large deformations. One way to summarise the material point method is: a finite element method where the integration points (material points) are allowed to move independently of the mesh.

%     Uncertainty due to inherent randomness.\\
%     Aleatory uncertainty is also referred to as stochastic uncertainty, variability, inherent uncertainty, uncertainty due to chance, and Type A uncertainty. The fundamental nature of aleatory uncertainty is randomness, e.g., from a stochastic process. Randomness can, in principle, be reduced, e.g., by improved control of a random process, but if it is removed, for example, by assumption, then you have fundamentally changed the nature of the analysis. Aleatory uncertainty can exist due to inter-individual differences, such as random heterogeneity in a population, and it can exist spatially or temporally. Sources of aleatory uncertainty can commonly be singled out from other contributors to uncertainty by their representation as randomly distributed quantities that may take on values in a known range, but for which the exact value will vary by chance from unit to unit, point to point in space, or time to time. The mathematical representation, or characterization, mostcommonly used for aleatory uncertainty is a probability distribution.

%   name={epistemic uncertainty},
%   description={
%     Uncertainty due to lack of knowledge.\\
%     Epistemic uncertainty is also referred to as reducible uncertainty, knowledge uncertainty, and subjective uncertainty. In the risk assessment community, it is common to refer to epistemic uncertainty simply as uncertainty and aleatory uncertainty as variability. The fundamental source of epistemic uncertainty is incomplete information or incomplete knowledge of any type that is related to the system of interest or its simulation. Epistemic uncertainty is a property of the modeler or observer, whereas aleatory uncertainty is a property of the system being modeled or observed. The lack of knowledge can be related to modeling issues for the system, computational issues of the model, or experimental data needed for validation. Modeling issues include lack of knowledge of characteristics or processes in the system, the initial state of the system, or the surroundings or environment of the system. Computational issues include programming mistakes, estimation of numerical solution errors, and numerical approximations in algorithms. Experimental data issues include incomplete knowledge of experimental information that is needed for simulation of the experiment and approximations or corrections that are made in the processing of the experimental data. An increase in knowledge or information can lead to a reduction in epistemic uncertainty and thereby a reduction in the uncertainty of the response of the system, given that no other changes are made.
