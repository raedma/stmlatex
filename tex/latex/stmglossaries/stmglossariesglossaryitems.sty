    The Material Point Method is an alternative to pure Lagrangian approaches and is well suited to problems involving very large deformations. In the method, equilibrium computations take place on a background grid but the calculations are based on information (mass, volume, stress, state variables, etc.) held at material points that are convected through the background grid as the material deforms. This allows computations to take place on an undistorted background mesh (structured or unstructured) whilst modelling problems involving very large deformations. One way to summarise the material point method is: a finite element method where the integration points (material points) are allowed to move independently of the mesh.
