# stmlatex
A collection of LaTeX packages for structural mechanics documentation. Aside from offering exemplary styles, e.g. for listings, plots, etc. the focus of this collection is solely on functionality. The document layout is not affected.

## Use stmlatex in your LaTeX distribution

stmlatex itself is organised as an TEXMF root directory. Therefore, it can easily be integrated in your local LaTeX distribution, see e.g. https://miktex.org/kb/texmf-roots
